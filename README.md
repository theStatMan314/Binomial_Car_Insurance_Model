<h1>Car Claims Predictive Model</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The code performs a thorough data analysis and modelling workflow for a car insurance claims dataset. It begins by importing the dataset and cleaning it to remove any rows with missing values. The data is then prepared for analysis by converting specific categorical variables into factors, making them suitable for modelling.

The code subsequently generates several visualisations to explore the data. These include a histogram to understand the distribution of annual mileage, a boxplot to compare annual mileage across different age groups, and bar charts to display the frequency of various vehicle types and racial categories. A correlation heatmap is created to show the relationships between numerical variables, highlighting strong correlations. Additional plots, such as a violin plot and density plot, further illustrate the distribution and density of annual mileage across different age and income groups. The ggpairs function provides a multi-dimensional view of the relationships between credit score, annual mileage, and age.

For predictive modelling, the data is split into training and test sets. Four different models are then built and evaluated: a Generalised Linear Model (GLM), a Random Forest model, a Generalised Additive Model (GAM), and a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Each model's performance is assessed based on accuracy, and confusion matrices are used to summarise the predictions versus actual outcomes.
